# 645-Project

Project : A formal approach to finding explanations for database queries

Reproducibility tasks: Read the paper and understand the methodology. You will need to implement Algorithm 1, and reproduce the results of Figures 2 and 15. Your results may differ somewhat from the ones in the paper, as the datasets have changed since publication.

Data: The results this mini-project aims to reproduce use the DBLP dataset, which you have worked with in prior assignments, and the GeoDBLP dataset. Please refer to the paper for details on the datasets and how they were used in this research.
